air drums and dance tutor project using Kinect 

This project was made during MIT Media Lab workshop held in Mumbai.

the project code covers basic skeleton detection and comparing the steps of dance. If the dance pose is correct it starts playing a music and if the song is wrong it stops.
i have added code for 2 dance steps.

the second part of the code is of air drums where you have 3 boxes or hot points and you can use them for kick, hit, snare. again done using kinect.
